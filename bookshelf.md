Some of the resources I've read which I highly recommend to others.

> _This vital book is a call to action: to reduce online harm, to protect the integrity of our digital lives and to uphold democratic participation and inclusion._

An great introduction to the topic of colonialism and what undoing that might look like for Aotearoa today, and justifiably on the best-seller list repeatedly.

> _Decolonisation is a term that alarms some, and gives hope to others. It is an uncomfortable and often bewildering concept for many New Zealanders._
> _This book seeks to demystify decolonisation using illuminating, real-life examples. By exploring the impact of colonisation on Māori and non-Māori alike, Imagining Decolonisation presents a transformative vision of a country that is fairer for all._

## The New Zealand Wars | Ngā Pakanga o Aotearoa

<a href="https://www.bwb.co.nz/books/new-zealand-wars/"><img src="/assets/images/shelf/The_New_Zealand_Wars.jpg" alt="Imagining Decolonisation book cover" class="book-img"></a>

This book really brings to life a period of history I was never taught in school. The writing is excellent, the images add richness, and it is so well done. Also justifiably a multi-award winner.

> _The New Zealand Wars were a series of conflicts that profoundly shaped the course and direction of our nation’s history._
> _Fought between the Crown and various groups of Māori between 1845 and 1872, the wars touched many aspects of life in nineteenth century New Zealand, even in those regions spared actual fighting._
> _Vincent O'Malley's new book provides a highly accessible introduction to the causes, events and consequences of the New Zealand Wars._

## Creativity, Inc.

<a href="creativityincbook.com/about/"><img src="/assets/images/shelf/creativity-inc.jpg" alt="Creativity, Inc. book cover" class="book-img"></a>

"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration" by Pixar's Ed Catmull was both a fascinating look behind the curtain at Pixar, and full of useful bits of advice which I found - dare I say it - inspiring for me thinking about my own future and how creativity plays a role in that.

> _Creativity, Inc. is a book for managers who want to lead their employees to new heights, a manual for anyone who strives for originality, and the first-ever, all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation—into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about how to build a creative culture—but it is also, as Pixar co-founder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible.”_

## HBR'S 10 Must Reads: The Essentials

<a href="https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-s-10-must-reads-the-essentials/13292"><img src="/assets/images/shelf/the-essentials.jpg" alt="The Essentials book cover" class="book-img"></a>

This collection of 10 articles takes me back to my MGMT101 uni days, but in a good way. I really liked that each article has a "put this in practice" section, and a bullet-point summary; you can either use this to decide whether to read the article, or to refresh your memory later on.

> _Change is the one constant in business, and we must adapt or face obsolescence. Yet certain challenges never go away. That's what makes this book "must read." These are the 10 seminal articles by management's most influential experts, on topics of perennial concern to ambitious managers and leaders hungry for inspiration--and ready to run with big ideas to accelerate their own and their companies' success._

## Agile Application Security

<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/agile-application-security/9781491938836/"><img src="/assets/images/shelf/agile-application-security.jpeg" alt="Agile Application Security book cover" class="book-img"></a>

This one is more niche than the above books. One of the authors, Laura Bell, taught me a lot of what I know when I had my first security consultant job with her at SafeStack. This book covers all the ground of what "application security" means and how it might look today.

> _Agile continues to be the most adopted software development methodology among organizations worldwide, but it generally hasn't integrated well with traditional security management techniques. And most security professionals aren’t up to speed in their understanding and experience of agile development. To help bridge the divide between these two worlds, this practical guide introduces several security tools and techniques adapted specifically to integrate with agile development._
> _Written by security experts and agile veterans, this book begins by introducing security principles to agile practitioners, and agile principles to security practitioners._
