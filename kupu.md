# Reo Māori kupu (words) for games

This is a list of kupu (words) that can be used in **drawing and guessing games** like Pictionary, [Skribbl](https://skribbl.io/), [Sketchful](https://sketchful.io/). 

It is aimed at being **beginner-friendly**. Here's how it works:

- You set up a game using the kupu word list.
- You provide all players with the Kupu & English translation table below.
- A player is given a kupu to draw. They can find out what the kupu means by looking at the table.
- The other players guess what the kupu is by looking at the drawing. If they know what it is in English, they can look up the kupu in the table below.

Notes:

1. There can be multiple kupu for the same word in English, and not all will be in the table above. Provide your players with this list in case they learnt a different kupu.
1. Some kupu may have different meanings to different iwi. I've done my best to double check using [MāoriDictionary.co.nz](https://maoridictionary.co.nz). Any errors are my own.
1. To add words or make corrections, please contribute [via GitHub](https://github.com/nickmalcolm/nickmalcolm.github.com/).
    1. Kupu should be relatively easy to draw and recognise. 
    1. Avoid kupu that might encourage drawing harmful or inaccurate stereotypes.
