title: I could log in to Yahoo Mail with any password
---

A little over a week ago I discovered a startling vulnerability in Yahoo Mail. I could log in to any of my accounts, and I presume many others, with any password. It seems to be fixed now, but Yahoo's response left much to be desired.

First I'll outline the vulnerability, then I'll discuss their response.

## Side note

I discovered this while working on [Triage](http://www.triage.cc), an iPhone app for busy people who struggle to stay on top of their email. [John Gruber said](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/04/18/triage) "since I’ve been using Triage, I’m more caught up on my email than I have been in years." You should [download Triage from the App Store now](http://www.appstore.com/triageemailfirstaid).

# The vulnerability

To be more specific, I could log into my accounts on Yahoo's IMAP servers with any password. Of the three accounts I tested, the first was created in April, the other two a couple of weeks ago. This issue didn't affect my colleague who had a much older Yahoo Mail account. Perhaps the date the accounts were created had something to do with it?

Here's a transcript of the commands I used. Nothing fancy. Just IMAP commands. I also made [a Youtube video of the vulnerability using three separate accounts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Uvnct-3Sw).

You can see, after connecting to the server, that I log in to the account "mailtriageapp@yahoo.com" with the password asdf. The password was not asdf, nor was it any of the other incorrect passwords I attempted. I could then open the Inbox, and read the first unready message.

To me that seems like a **huge** vulnerability.

# Yahoo's response

I immediately reported this to the Yahoo security team, and included transcripts of exploiting this with two of my accounts. This was on the 9th of May. Unfortunately, [like others have noted](http://www.nilsjuenemann.de/2013/05/yahoo-please-start-with-vulnerability.html), their response left much to be desired.

When you email security@yahoo-inc.com, you get an automated response: 

> This is an **automated message** acknowledging your recent submission for help to Yahoo! Customer Care.
>

Like so many companies, Yahoo sent a "do not reply to this email" email. I simply can't understand why any company would want to ignore user feedback. At the very least it should be simple enough to tack a customer's response to the support ticket.

Later that day I got another seemingly automated response.

The reason I suspect this is a robot:

 * Leslie "analyzed" my message. Who says they analyzed a message?!
 * Why would she suggest I learn how to register a Yahoo! ID? I obviously already have two of them.

Again I was faced with the familiar "Please do not reply to this message". To make matters worse, the suggested "contact Yahoo! Accounts team" link did not work in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, neither when I was logged in or out of a Yahoo account.

I replied to Leslie with the strong suggestion of sending this directly to the security team, and also told her the contact form was broken. Later that night I made [the Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4Uvnct-3Sw), just to prove I wasn't making things up. 

About three days later I noticed that Yahoo was now refusing bad passwords. That's pretty quick, so at least someone is paying attention over there. All's well that ends well, I guess.

I'm not sure what I expected. It feels good to have reported my first vulnerability. Especially one which seems to be so simple, yet very serious and far reaching. A thank you might have been nice.

But I really wish all companies, from startups to global behemoths, would stop sending "Do not reply" messages. It's so impersonal. Just don't do it.
