I'm Nick, and I work in information security, most often in application security roles. I help teams understand and adopt pragmatic security practices at the right time in the software development lifecycle, so that security is built in from the beginning. I work with teams of all sizes; from government departments and large banks, through to startups and small businesses.
 
My current role is a security consultant at at [Aura Information Security](https://www.aurainfosec.com). I was previously at [SafeStack](https://safestack.io) in a similar role and, before that, CTO at [ThisData](https://thisdata.com), a security API which protected millions of people across the globe from account takeover attacks.


Things that push my buttons include: helping people solve their problems using my techy skills, cyber security, building stuff with Ruby on Rails, writing, and presenting at meetups and conferences.


I like to spend time with my wife and two boys, sing, play guitar, go to church, run, and hax on side projects.
